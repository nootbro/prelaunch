### Utility Components

1. **Theme Provider**
   - `theme-provider.tsx`: Provides theme context for the application

2. **Section Header**
   - `section-header.tsx`: Consistent header component for sections

## Architecture Patterns

### Data Management

The application uses a data-driven approach with centralized data files:

1. **Metrics Data**
   - Stored in `data/metrics.ts`
   - Includes mission control metrics and detailed metrics

2. **Testimonial Data**
   - Stored in `data/testimonials.ts`
   - Contains user testimonials with images and quotes

3. **Feature Data**
   - Stored in `data/features.ts`
   - Describes platform features with icons and descriptions

4. **Site Configuration**
   - Stored in `data/site-config.ts`
   - Contains site-wide settings and theme configuration

### Component Design Patterns

1. **Composition Pattern**
   - Components are composed of smaller, reusable components
   - UI components are combined to create section components

2. **Props Interface Pattern**
   - Each component has a clearly defined props interface
   - TypeScript ensures type safety for component props

3. **Responsive Design Pattern**
   - Components adapt to different screen sizes
   - Media queries and responsive utilities ensure proper display

4. **Animation Pattern**
   - Animations are applied consistently across components
   - CSS animations for simple effects
   - React-based animations for complex interactions

### Custom Hooks

1. **Media Query Hook**
   - `use-media-query.ts`: Provides responsive design utilities

2. **Intersection Observer Hook**
   - `use-intersection-observer.ts`: Enables scroll-based animations

## Styling Approach

1. **CSS Variables**
   - Global CSS variables defined in `styles/variables.css`
   - Consistent color scheme and spacing

2. **Animation Classes**
   - Reusable animation classes in `styles/animations.css`
   - Consistent animation timing and effects

3. **Tailwind Integration**
   - Tailwind CSS for utility-based styling
   - Custom Tailwind configuration for project-specific design

## Performance Considerations

1. **Component Optimization**
   - Components are designed to minimize re-renders
   - Memoization used for expensive calculations

2. **Image Optimization**
   - Next.js Image component for optimized image loading
   - Proper image sizing and formats

3. **Animation Performance**
   - CSS animations for better performance
   - Animation throttling for resource-intensive effects

## Accessibility Features

1. **Semantic HTML**
   - Proper use of semantic HTML elements
   - ARIA attributes for enhanced accessibility

2. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Components support keyboard navigation
   - Focus management for interactive elements

3. **Color Contrast**
   - Sufficient color contrast for text readability
   - Status colors designed for accessibility

## Development Guidelines

1. **Component Creation**
   - Follow existing patterns for new components
   - Place components in appropriate directories

2. **Styling Guidelines**
   - Use consistent color scheme and typography
   - Follow visual effect guidelines

3. **Code Quality**
   - Maintain component focus and responsibility
   - Optimize for performance and accessibility

## Future Improvements

1. **Testing Implementation**
   - Add unit tests for components
   - Add integration tests for key user flows

2. **State Management**
